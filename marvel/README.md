Marvel Project

1. Integrated the marvel api to search marvel database for character names and info.
2. parsed the info using ajax and jquery into html propagation.
3. used html and css to style the page thus allowing the user to see information.
4. used a modal to explain to the user the functionality of the page.
5. added user nav and links to give user list of characters and added feature.
6. added a page for super hero power using array to math random generate a power for user to receive power

Installation:

1. Create an account with marvel
2. Recieve Api keys
3. MD5 hash api keys for access
4. integrate api keys into ajax access

Approach:
I wanted to create a simple application that the user can have fun with and spend time searching their favorite characters with a theme that is very Marvel. I wanted simple instructions and simple to use UI with a pop up modal and option mission button if the user does not understand again.

I also added a fun what is your superpower option where if you enter your name I added a list of power in array to return the user a power and return using Jquery.

Problems:

I could not find a way to report an error to the user if the name of the character was found every time I set that data was undefined it would always alert due to the fact that some elements would always return undefined.

Summary: I had fun interactively building this project and putting together every piece.
